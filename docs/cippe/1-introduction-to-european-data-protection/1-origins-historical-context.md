## 1.1 Rationale for data protection
- Increasing use of computers in the early 1970s
- Transborder trade facilitated by the European Economic Community (EEC)

## 1.2 Human rights law
### 1.2.1 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- Adopted on 10 December, 1948

#### Article 12
> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

- Protection from arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, correspondence
- Protection from attacks on honour and reputation

#### Article 19
> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

- Right to freedom of opinion and expression without interference
- Right to seek, impart, receive ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers

#### Article 29 
> 1. Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.
> 2. In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.
> These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

- Resolves apparent contradiction between Art. 12 and Art. 19 by applying limits to individual rights and freedoms
- Out of recognition and respect for the rights of others
- To meet the just requirements for morality, public order and general welfare in a democratic society

### 1.2.2 European Convention on Human Rights
- Promulgated in Rome in 1950 by the Council of Europe
- Invited individual states to be signatories
- Only applies to member states
	- All Council of Europe states are members
- Went into effect on 3 September 1953
- Core protections
	- Right to life
	- Prohibition of torture
	- Prohibition of slavery and forced labour
	- Right to liberty and security
	- Right to a fair trial
	- No punishment without law
	- <mark>Respect for private and family life</mark>
	- Freedom of thought, conscience and religion

	- Freedom of assembly and association
	- Right to marry
	- Right to effective remedy
	- Prohibition of discrimination

#### Article 8
> 1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
life, his home and his correspondence.
> 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the
law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the
country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection
of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms
of others.

- Pretty much the same as [Article 12](https://nikmeiser.github.io/cipp/cippe/1-introduction-to-european-data-protection/1-origins-historical-context.html#article-12) from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- Unlike Article 12, however, it also some limits on these rights in the interests of public safety and the rights of others

#### Article 10
> 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right
shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart
information and ideas without interference by public authority
and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States
from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema
enterprises.
> 2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it
duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities,
conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and
are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national
security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention
of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for
the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing
the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

- Supports and expands upon [Article 19](https://nikmeiser.github.io/cipp/cippe/1-introduction-to-european-data-protection/1-origins-historical-context.html#article-19) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- Just like Article 8 above, this right is not absolute and can be limited under certain specific circumstances

## 1.3 Early laws and regulation
- From the 1960s to the 1980s a number of European countries started adopting laws controlling the use of personal information
- Emerging technologies were also threatening to undermine [Article 8](https://nikmeiser.github.io/cipp/cippe/1-introduction-to-european-data-protection/1-origins-historical-context.html#article-8) of the EHCR
- In light of these trends the Council of Europe agreed to adopt [Recommendation 509](https://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=14546&lang=en) in January 1968
- [Resolution 73/22](https://rm.coe.int/1680502830) was adopted on 23 September 1973 to protect personal information stored in data banks of private sector companies
- [Resolution 74/29](https://rm.coe.int/16804d1c51) was adopted on 20 September 1974 to protect personal information stored in teh data banks of the public sector

### 1.3.1 OECD Guidelines

#### Origins of the OECD
- The OECD grew out of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) which was formed to administer American and Canadian aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan
- It provided the framework that would go on to establish the European Free Trade Area and the European Economic Committee
- The OECD was formed in 1961 to fulfill a more global mission and to improve trade and cooperation with countries outside Europe and North America

#### The OECD and Privacy
- Published the [OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data](https://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm) on 23 September 1980
- Not legally binding
- In close alignment with principles that were being developed by the Council of Europe
- A lot of similarities between the OECD Guidelines and [Convention 108](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/108.htm), also know as Convention 108
- Aim is the unimpeded flow of personal data across international borders
- Applies to both the public and private sector
- Applies to all personal data irrespective of whether it is gathered electronically or otherwise
- Applies to automated and manual systems alike

### 1.3.2 Convention 108
- Also called the [Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data](https://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm)
- First legally binding international treaty related to data protection
- Adopted by Council of Europe on 28 January 1981
- Deliberately not called a 'European Convention' to signify that it allowed signatories from outside of Europe
- Differs from the OECD Guidelines in that - 
	- it requires the signatories to incorporate the principles as safeguards within domestic law to protect personal information
	- holding or using personal information in digitized formats entails a corresponding social responsibility to protect the data from misuse
- Has three main parts - 
	- Chapter II: substantive law provisions
	- Chapter III: special rules on transborder flows
	- Chapter IV: mutual assistance

#### 1.3.2.1 Chapter II: Basic Principles of National Application
- Based on principles contained in the Council of Europe's [Resolution 73/22](https://rm.coe.int/1680502830) and [Resolution 74/29](https://rm.coe.int/16804d1c51)
- Any personal information subject to automatic data process should - 
	- be lawfully and fairly obtained (Collection Limitation Principle)
	- be relevant to the purpose it was gathered for and should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date (Data Quality Principle)
	- specify the purpose for which it is being collected at the time of collection
