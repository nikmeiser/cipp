## 1.1 Rationale for data protection
- Increasing use of computers in the early 1970s
- Transborder trade facilitated by the European Economic Community (EEC)

## 1.2 Human rights law
### 1.2.1 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- Adopted on 10 December, 1948

#### Article 12
> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

- Protection from arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, correspondence
- Protection from attacks on honour and reputation

#### Article 19
> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

- Right to freedom of opinion and expression without interference
- Right to seek, impart, receive ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers

#### Article 29 
> 1. Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.
> 2. In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.
> These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

- Resolves apparent contradiction between Art. 12 and Art. 19 by applying limits to individual rights and freedoms
- Out of recognition and respect for the rights of others
- To meet the just requirements for morality, public order and general welfare in a democratic society

### 1.2.2 European Convention on Human Rights
- Promulgated in Rome in 1950 by the Council of Europe
- Went into effect on 3 September 1953
- Invited individual states to be signatories
- Only applies to member states
	- All Council of Europe states are members
- Core protections
	- Right to life
	- Prohibition of torture
	- Prohibition of slavery and forced labour
	- Right to liberty and security
	- Right to a fair trial
	- No punishment without law
	- <mark>Respect for private and family life</mark>
	- Freedom of thought, conscience and religion
	- Freedom of expression
	- Freedom of assembly and association
	- Right to marry
	- Right to effective remedy
	- Prohibition of discrimination
- Enforced by the European Court of Human Rights
	- Rulings of the ECHR are binding on the signitaries

#### Article 8
> 1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
life, his home and his correspondence.
> 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the
law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the
country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection
of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms
of others.

- Pretty much the same as [Article 12](https://nikmeiser.github.io/cipp/cippe/1-introduction-to-european-data-protection/1-origins-historical-context.html#article-12) from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- Unlike Article 12, however, it also some limits on these rights in the interests of public safety and the rights of others

#### Article 10
> 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right
shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart
information and ideas without interference by public authority
and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States
from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema
enterprises.
> 2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it
duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities,
conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and
are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national
security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention
of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for
the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing
the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

- Supports and expands upon [Article 19](https://nikmeiser.github.io/cipp/cippe/1-introduction-to-european-data-protection/1-origins-historical-context.html#article-19) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- Just like Article 8 above, this right is not absolute and can be limited under certain specific circumstances

## 1.3 Early laws and regulation
- From the 1960s to the 1980s a number of European countries started adopting laws controlling the use of personal information
- Emerging technologies were also threatening to undermine [Article 8](https://nikmeiser.github.io/cipp/cippe/1-introduction-to-european-data-protection/1-origins-historical-context.html#article-8) of the EHCR
- In light of these trends the Council of Europe agreed to adopt [Recommendation 509](https://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=14546&lang=en) in January 1968
- [Resolution 73/22](https://rm.coe.int/1680502830) was adopted on 23 September 1973 to protect personal information stored in data banks of private sector companies
- [Resolution 74/29](https://rm.coe.int/16804d1c51) was adopted on 20 September 1974 to protect personal information stored in teh data banks of the public sector

### 1.3.1 OECD Guidelines

#### Origins of the OECD
- The OECD grew out of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) which was formed to administer American and Canadian aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan
- It provided the framework that would go on to establish the European Free Trade Area and the European Economic Committee
- The OECD was formed in 1961 to fulfill a more global mission and to improve trade and cooperation with countries outside Europe and North America

#### The OECD and Privacy
- Published the [OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data](https://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm) on 23 September 1980
- Not legally binding
- In close alignment with principles that were being developed by the Council of Europe
- A lot of similarities between the OECD Guidelines and [Convention 108](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/108.htm), also know as Convention 108
- Aim is the unimpeded flow of personal data across international borders
- Applies to both the public and private sector
- Applies to all personal data irrespective of whether it is gathered electronically or otherwise
- Applies to automated and manual systems alike

### 1.3.2 Convention 108
- Also called the [Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data](https://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm)
- First legally binding international treaty related to data protection
- Adopted by Council of Europe on 28 January 1981
- Deliberately not called a 'European Convention' to signify that it allowed signatories from outside of Europe
- Differs from the OECD Guidelines in that - 
	- it requires the signatories to incorporate the principles as safeguards within domestic law to protect personal information
	- holding or using personal information in digitized formats entails a corresponding social responsibility to protect the data from misuse
- Has three main parts - 
	- Chapter II: substantive law provisions
	- Chapter III: special rules on transborder flows
	- Chapters IV and V: mutual assistance

#### 1.3.2.1 Chapter II: Basic Principles of National Application
- Based on principles contained in the Council of Europe's [Resolution 73/22](https://rm.coe.int/1680502830) and [Resolution 74/29](https://rm.coe.int/16804d1c51)
- Any personal information subject to automatic data process should - 
	- be lawfully and fairly obtained (Collection Limitation Principle)
	- be relevant to the purpose it was gathered for and should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date (Data Quality Principle)
	- specify the purpose for which it is being collected at the time of collection (Purpose Specification Principle)
	- never be disclosed or made available for a purpose incompatible with the specified purpose, except where 
		- a) the data subject (person) has given consent, or
		- b) there is a justified legal reason to do so (Use Limitation Principle)
	- be protected from unauthorized access, unauthorized use, unauthorized modification, unauthorized disclosure and from accidental loss (Security Safeguards Principle)
	- offer transparency about the existence of personal data, the practices and policies that are used to govern it and the identity and location of the dat acontroller (Openness Principle)
	- give the individual the right
		- a) to confirm if a data controller has any data related to them
		- b) to be notified of the data related to them 
			- i) within a reasonable time
			- ii) at a reasonable cost
			- iii) in a form that is readily intelligible
		- c) to be given a reason if a request made under a) or b) are denied, and to challenge that reason
		- d) to challenge data relating to them and, if the challenge is successful, to have the data erased, rectified, completed or amended (Individual Participation Principle)
	- ensure that the data processor or any third-party working on behalf of the data controller is accountable under the law (Accountability Principle)

#### Chapter III: Basic Principles of International Application: Free Flow and Legitimate Restrictions
- When European data protection legislation first emerged in the 1970s, some critics in the USA saw it as a protectionist measure to protect domestic markets from US suppliers of computer services
- There is additional sensitivity to trade protectionism since this is a binding international treaty, enforceable by law
- This section emphasizes that the data protection laws should not be used to protect or regulate domestic markets or inhibit trade
- The explantory memorandum further clarifies that this section does not limit the rights of any member countries to regulate its own trade economic conditions -
	> Paragraph 18 is not intended to limit the rights of Member countries to regulate transborder flows of personal data in areas relating to free trade, tariffs, employment, and related economic conditions for intentional data traffic. These are matters which were not addressed by the Expert Group, being outside its Mandate.
- The section provides for two derogation exceptions that allow for restricting the flow of data - 
	1. Members can restrict the flow of data to and from countries that do not observe the provisions of the Convention
	2. It allows member countries which have additional data protection requirements under their national law to restrict the flow of those data to any country that does not offer an equivalent protection for those data
- This section establishes the principle of equivalency to facilitate the flow of data across international boundaries
- An unresolved problem in this section is the choice of jurisdiction when there are conflicts between the laws of different countries
- An '[Additional Protocol](https://rm.coe.int/1680080626)' was added on 8 November 2001
	- It created a framework for data transfers to countries which were not signatories to Convention 108 if - 
		- a) The data controller can demonstrate safeguards resulting from contractual clauses
		- b) the supervising authority deems these safeguards as adequate in efficacy to domestic law
	- Data transfer to non-members were allowed provided that - 
		- a) It was in the interest of the individual
		- b) It was in the public interest

#### Chapter IV: National Implementation
- The member states have an obligation to make the provisions of the Convention part of their legal system
- The '[Additional Protocol](https://rm.coe.int/1680080626)' added a requirement for each member country to set up a supervisory authority to ensure compliance with the Convention - 
	- The supervisory authority has the power to investigate, to intervene and to engage in legal proceedings when domestic laws that give effect to the Convention are violated
	- It hears claims from individuals regarding their fundamental rights and personal freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data

#### Chapter V: International Cooperation
- The supervisory authorities, in addition to providing domestic governance also form part of the machinery for cross-border cooperation
- Supervisory authorities help in three main areas - 
	1. They are the source of information about domestic framework of rules, regulations and decisions that implement Convention requirememts. There are often several levels of regulation and many rules cannot be laid down permanently in detailed statutory provisions to give lower level decision-making bodies some discretion
	2. They assist entities from other member states with interpretation and in meeting the local regulatory requirements
	3. They assist data subjects who reside abroad

### 1.3.3 Convention 108+
- This section is redundant as Convention 108+ is dealt with in greater detail in section 1.7. I have left it here to be consistent with the IAPP text book. I'm guessing they left in there for continuity.


## 1.4 The need for a harmonised European approach
- The intent of Convention 108 and the OECD Guidelines was to create a coordinated approach to data protection while leaving the implemementation to the member countries
- Over time it became apparent that in practice local implementations had created divergent data protection regimes, which had troublesome ramifications for both individual privacy and free trade

### 1.4.1 Data Protection Directive
#### Background 
- A "directive" is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all EU countries must achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries to devise their own laws on how to reach these goals. 
- Before creating the directive, the European Commission prepared a [Proposal for a Council Directive concerning the protection of individuals in relation to the processing of personal data](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:51990PC0314(01)&from=EN) on 27 July 1990 in which they - 
	- noted the diversity of national approaches
	- identified a lack of safeguards for data privacy at the community level
	- concluded that these would lead to cross-border flows of data being impeded

#### Enactment
- The proposal led to the creation of [Directive 95/46/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046&from=EN), also known as the 'Data Protection Directive'
- The Directive was enacted on 24 October 1995 and came into effect on 13 December 1995
- Members were given until 24 October 1998 to transpose it into national law or risk being penalized by the Commission
- It was intended to -
	- build upon Convention 108
	- bring greater alignment between national laws on data privacy
	- extend data protections to both automated and nonautomated personal data
	- cover both, the public and and the private sectors
- The Directive gave the European Commission the power to issue infraction proceedings against a member state which did not implement the Directive correctly
- Even the Directive wasn't successful in preventing the inconsistencies between national laws which was confirmed by the [First report on the implementation of the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52003DC0265&from=EN) which was published on 15 May 2003. It cited - 
	- Incorrect implementation of the Directive
	- Incorrect derogation requests 
	- Inconsistencies in implementation even within the margins of manoeuvre (e.g. the requirements for notifying local Data Protection Authorities)
