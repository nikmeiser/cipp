## What is 'CIPP'?
CIPP stands for 'Certified Information Privacy Professional'. It is an [accreditation](https://iapp.org/certify/cipp/) that is administered by the [International Assocation of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)](https://iapp.org/about/)

## About these notes
These notes were made by [me](https://github.com/nikmeiser) starting in October 2022 and are based on the study guides published by the IAPP. There are four main accreditations that apply to different geographies - 
 - CIPP/US: USA
 - CIPP/C: Canada
 - CIPP/E: Europe
 - CIPP/A: Asia
