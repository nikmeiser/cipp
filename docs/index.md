## Site Privacy
This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). Here are [Github's privacy policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies). 

This site uses a Jekyll template called [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). The [template](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) as well as [this site](https://github.com/nikmeiser/cipp/tree/main/docs) are open source. 

I do not track usage analytics nor serve ads on this site and I do not collect data about you and as far as I can tell there is nothing in the Jekyll site template that tracks usage. However the hostting site (Github pages) does collect data and use cookies and you should read their [privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## What is 'CIPP'?
CIPP stands for 'Certified Information Privacy Professional'. It is an [accreditation](https://iapp.org/certify/cipp/) that is administered by the [International Assocation of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)](https://iapp.org/about/)

## About these notes
